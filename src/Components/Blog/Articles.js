          <p>
            Budding is the transfer of a bud from 1 plant to another plant. You
            can do budding between different cultivars of the same species, and
            in some cases, between different species. Unlike grafting, which
            attaches the entire upper part of a plant, budding only attaches the
            bud to a different plant. T budding works well during the summer,
            when the second plant is actively growing and the bark is healthy
            enough to peel from the trunk without breaking. Chip budding can be
            used instead during the spring or early fall if the second plant’s
            bark isn’t quite as “live.” Patch budding, meanwhile, requires
            simpler cuts than the other 2, making it ideal for plants with tough
            barks.

          <b className="text-3xl font-bold ">1</b> Cut a “budstick” from its
          source. Search for fully matured buds growing along the original plant
          (often called a “scion” in budding). Prioritize branches that are
          still actively growing well away from the plant’s stem, on the outside
          of the scion’s canopy. Look for buds that appear fat and healthy where
          leaf stems grow from the branch. Cut the branch from the scion and
          then snip away any leaves from the branch. This is now your
          “budstick.”[1] When cutting away the leaves, make your cut at the base
          of the blades so that the stem is still attached to the branch.
          Matured buds of one species of plant may look considerably different
          from another. Search online for images and descriptions for the
          particular plant that you are budding. Make sure that your plant is
          capable of budding before you start. Some plants will only graft to
          particular species of plants while other plants may not graft at all.

          <p>
            <b className="text-3xl font-bold">2</b> Carve a “bud shield” for
            grafting. Hold the bud stick so that the leaf stem is pointing away
            from you. Use a sharpened knife to begin your cut roughly a
            half-inch below the stem’s base. Slice into the bud stick toward the
            leaf stem. Curve your blade into the wood and then outward, in a
            crescent-moon motion, so that it comes out a half-inch above the
            stem. You should now have a small shaving of wood to graft into a
            new plant, the bud itself, and the leaf stem to use as a handle, all
            in one piece (this piece is called a “bud shield”).[2]
            <li>
              To make sure the bud doesn’t go flying, remove the blade from the
              budstick just before it breaks the surface on its way out. From
              the outside, slice a cut a half-inch above the stem, as though
              crossing a “T” along the top of your original cut.
            </li>
            <li>
              You also can do I-budding, where you cut a capital "I," with one
              horizontal cut at each end of the vertical cut.
            </li>
            <li>
              These cuts should be as smooth as possible. Rough sawing actions
              with your knife will prevent the wood from successfully grafting
              with the new plant.
            </li>

          <p>
            <b className="text-3xl font-bold">3</b> Make a T-cut in the new
            plant. Choose a smooth spot on the stem of the new plant (called a
            “root stock”) to graft your bud to. Make the vertical cut first,
            from top to bottom, along the stem. Keep it to the same size as the
            length of your bud shield. Then make a horizontal cut along the top
            to form your “T.”[3]
            <li>
              Alternately, you can make your horizontal cut along the bottom of
              the vertical cut. This will allow excess water or sap to drain
              from the root stock more efficiently.
            </li>

          <p>
            <b className="text-3xl font-bold">4</b>Create a pocket. Peel the
            bark away from your T-cut. Start from the inside corners where the
            vertical and horizontal cuts meet. Peel outward until a triangle of
            the plant’s tissue is exposed. Stop here, without tearing the peeled
            bark off the stem.[4] If the bark resists peeling, this may be a
            sign that the root stock has not fully recovered from its winter
            dormancy. Wait until its dormant cycle is completely over before
            grafting. Usually this is during the height of summer.[5]

          <p>
            <b className="text-3xl font-bold">5</b>Trim the bud shield if
            needed. Hold the bud shield by its leaf stem. Line it up with the
            vertical cut in the root stock. Place the bud shield’s wood shaving
            against the root stock’s exposed tissue. If the top of the wood
            shaving is higher than the root stock’s horizontal cut, cut off the
            extra wood so that it doesn’t stick out.[6]

          <p>
            <b className="text-3xl font-bold">6</b>Graft the bud shield to the
            root stock. Once the bud shield lines up perfectly with the root
            stock’s vertical cut, line the two up. Smooth the two flaps of
            peeled bark over the bud shield to cover it. Wind grafting tape
            around and around the root stock to seal the graft, leaving only the
            bud shield’s leaf stem and bud exposed. Let the plant heal for two
            to three weeks, then remove the grafting tape. Trim the root stock
            above the bud shield to motivate growth from the scion bud[7]
            <li>
              If it is too late in the season to expect growth immediately, wait
              until winter to trim the top of the root stock.

            <li>
              Budding rubbers, which break down naturally, can be used instead
              of grafting tape.
