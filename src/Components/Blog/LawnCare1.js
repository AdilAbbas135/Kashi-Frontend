          <b className="text-xl font-bold">GET TO KNOW YOUR SOIL</b>
          <br />
          When it comes to turf, what happens above ground reflects what's going
          on underneath. When optimal soil pH levels combine with beneficial
          microbial activity in healthy soils, your grasses can better access
          the essential plant nutrients they need to grow thick, lush and green.
          Take advice from lawn pros and test your soil so you know your
          starting point for essentials such as soil pH. Your local county
          extension office or agricultural agent will have information on test
          kits and reputable soil laboratories. You can take accurate soil
          samples yourself. Include separate samples for problem spots, such as
          bare areas or sections with unwanted lawn moss. Let the lab know
          you're testing lawn areas; they can tailor recommendations to get your
          lawn on track for your plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b className="text-xl font-bold">FIX UNDERLYING ISSUES:</b>
          <br />
          With test results in hand, turn recommendations into projects. Correct
          problems now — don't risk repeats. Use soil amendments according to
          lab recommendations to improve your lawn's potential. Lime, for
          example, restores balance to soil pH so grasses can draw on available
          nutrients. Hit tough spots first, and then repair bare lawn patches.
          The all-in-one ease of Pennington One Step Complete simplifies
          patching and repairs by pre-mixing premium grass seed,
          professional-grade fertilizer and protective wood mulch in a single
          product. All-in-one Pennington Smart Patch bare spot repair combines
          drought-tolerant Smart Seed, fertilizer and mulch, but this premium
          product also brings your lawn beneficial microbials that enhance your
          soil's health and actively work to neutralize underlying soil and lawn
          problems — whatever their cause. If your family includes pets, you're
          sure to have some pet damage. But don't worry: Smart Patch handles
          soil issues related to dog urine while repairing bare lawn spots.
          Lush, new grass establishes quickly, so healthy lawns and happy dogs
          can coexist.

            KNOW THE BEST GRASSES FOR YOUR REGION:
          </b>
          <br />
          Grasses suited to their growing region create exceptional lawns. Just
          like garden flowers or shrubs, turfgrasses vary in their climate
          preferences and tolerances for drought, shade and other conditions.
          One benefit of seed over sod is your expanded choice of grass
          varieties with specific qualities, from durability to texture beneath
          bare feet. Cool-season grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass, peak in
          growth during cool temperatures in fall and spring. They flourish in
          northern zones. Warm-season grasses, such as Bermudagrass, excel in
          summer heat and warmer climates. Region-appropriate lawn grasses
          require less water and other resources, including maintenance time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b className="text-xl font-bold"> SEED RIGHT THE FIRST TIME:</b>
          <br />
          Whether seeding new areas, overseeding your lawn or thickening
          existing grass, timing is important. Plan your seeding to correspond
          with seasonal grass growth and the best time to plant grass.Plant seed
          properly, and avoid the common grass seeding mistakes many homeowners
          make. Take time to understand how to read a seed tag and know who's
          behind the seed you buy. Many companies sell seed purchased on the
          open market—and the contents may surprise you. But with premium grass
          seed such as purebred Pennington Smart Seed, you can buy the best
          grass seed with confidence and enjoy a sustainable lawn and increased
          resistance to drought, diseases and insect pests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b className="text-xl font-bold">FEED YOUR GRASSES WELL:</b>
          <br />
          Lawn grasses need proper nutrition. Nitrogen is especially important
          to keep your lawn lush, vibrant and green. Your soil test results will
          recommend how many pounds of nitrogen your lawn needs annually
          (usually per 1,000 square feet), based on its organic matter and other
          considerations. The numbers on fertilizer labels reveal the
          percentages of actual nitrogen and other nutrients products contain,
          so you can match the product to your needs. Be careful, though:
          feeding too much or too often causes more harm than good. Establish a
          feeding schedule that meets your lawn's fertilizer needs, and stick to
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b className="text-xl font-bold">FIGHT LAWN WEEDS:</b>
          <br />
          Even when freshly planted, lawns usually inherit weeds and weed seeds.
          Weeds compete with grasses for nutrients, water and light. Learn about
          common lawn weeds and how to kill broadleaf weeds, so you eliminate
          the labor and expense of repeated treatments.
        </p>
        <img src="./Articles/grass2.jpg" alt="Grass" className="mt-4" />
        <div>
          <p>
            Avoid pre-emergent weed controls, such as crabgrass preventers, and
            combination weed-and-feed fertilizers anywhere you're planting new
            grass seed. These products are designed to keep weed seeds from
            germinating and rooting properly, but they can work against grass
            seed in the same way. Target tough turf weeds with effective spot
            treatments.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b className="text-xl font-bold"> MOW FOR HEIGHT AND HEALTH:</b>
          <br />
          Always follow best practices for lawn mowing, and mow based on grass
          growth, not the day of the week. Mowing heights vary according to
          grass type and the season. Some grasses, such as Bermudagrass, are
          best kept short, while other types need more height. Hot spells
          warrant higher mowing heights all around. Change mowing heights
          gradually over several sessions. Never remove more than one-third of
          the blade length at a time, or you risk inhibiting good growth above
          and below ground. Make tasks easier and less time-consuming by using
          the right turf tools for the job, based on your lawn's size and your
          goals.
          <br />
          <b className="text-xl font-bold">ANAGE WATER WISELY:</b>
          <br />
          Lawn grasses grow best when watered deeply at less frequent intervals.
          Shallow, frequent watering encourages shallow roots susceptible to
          drought and other stress. With good watering practices and
          water-conserving grass varieties, you can reduce consumption, save on
          bills, and grow healthier, more resilient grass. Water Star grasses,
          such as Pennington Smart Seed varieties, require up to 30% less water
          than ordinary grass seed, year after year.
        </p>
        <img src="./Articles/grass3.jpg" alt="Grass" className="mt-4" />
        <p>
          Watering and other lawn tasks naturally vary from month to month
          through your seasonal lawn care calendar, but you should always
          accommodate what's happening in your lawn. Pay close attention to
          real-time weather and statistics for your specific location to help
          determine water needs during normal seasons and times of drought.
